Slick Chess

Borrowed Java Chess code (Arvydas Bancewicz) and refactored with the Slick opengl library.
Added animations using sprite sheets.
I used sprites from this website for the SPRITES image set: http://www.reinerstilesets.de/

Maven Notes:

The Slick dependencies are not in a public Maven Nexus repository (not that I could find) so I patched them manually in my M2 local.
Check the pom.xml for the detail.
